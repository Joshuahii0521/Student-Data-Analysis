# Student Success Analysis and Prediction

In this notebook we will be analyzing the Open University Learning Analytics dataset. This dataset contains information about seven courses referred to as module, the students taking these courses, and their interactions with the courses. These courses were taken over the course of two years and offered Febuary and October of 2013 and 2014. The analysis of this dataset is done with the goal of discovering relationships between student features, course features and the overall student outcome. We will begin with exploring the data, which is distributed between seven CSV files, and then apply machine learning algorithms to see what relationships we can tease out.
